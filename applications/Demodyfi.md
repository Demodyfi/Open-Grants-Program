Open Grant Proposal

Project: Demodyfi
Proposer: Demodyfi Ltd
Payment Address: 0x2f42dbB682c96b00D5dA340771E8AeA9bc74250F

Project Overview 📄

Introduction
Although inspired by the current DEX's on the market, Demodyfi is a decentralized financial platform with a vision to bring financial stability, liquidity and accessibility into the mainstream. It is the go-to open platform for finance-oriented dApps to implement on with smart contracts or integrated protocols with out-of-box cross-chain capabilities, security and financial optimizations.

Project Details

Architecture
The Demodyfi protocol supports the value interoperability between different parachains, allowing the tokens on the Polkadot chain to be quickly traded and circulated. The protocol is integrating and combining communication between different blockchains: "Ethereum Compatibility = “blockchains on parachains Architecture.” The protocol utilizes Moonbeam’s parachain smart contract interoperability while the Substrate framework serves as a fundamental layer. Combining this makes it potential to build on Polkadot, furthermore make it compatible with the EVM, and to deploy EVM-based bytecode compiled from Solidity using tools available from the Ethereum stack.

By Building on Moonbeam, Polkadot and Substrate provide the basis for new forms of societal organization and decision-making. Demodyfi is utilizing Substrate’s governance and treasury management capabilities along with Polkadot’s cross-chain messaging to create a decentralized sovereign wealth fund. The goal for this is to fund and secure a parachain slot and continue further development.

Additional Information ➕
We have already received attention from a consortium of very well-known investors and projects, yet we are focusing on Product dev. Polygon and Moonbeam are willing to support in any way possible as they believe in the development of the project. 

Creating fundamental grounds for product development. Connecting to Moonbeam Alpha. Talking with other projects such as Reef / Tidal.finance / Polkalokr, Cere Network and other Polka and Eth based projects. Also, in talk with Polkadot defi alliance as we have close communication lines.

Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project? 
No, but are willing to (Polygon and Moonbeam)

Have you applied for other grants so far? 
Yes, to moonbeam grant. The primarily goal is to set up a partnership and initially not receiving funds, because we think an official partnership is more valuable  to the project. Basically, Demodyfi is supporting Moonbeam as an AMM and is creating more volume towards the moonbeam ecosystem. Secondly, to contribute in the adoption and scalability. Status of contact is that we have close communication lines with the Moonbeam team as we are now in the status of sharing our code base. 

Scope would look like: 
Moonbeam alpha -> Ethereum launch -> Bridge implementation -> DMOD & Moonriver Deployment -> Launch EVM-Moonbeam parachain.
