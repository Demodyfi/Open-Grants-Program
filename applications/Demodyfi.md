# Open Grant Proposal

**Project**: Demodyfi
**Proposer**: Demodyfi Ltd
**Payment Address**: 0x2f42dbB682c96b00D5dA340771E8AeA9bc74250F

## Project Overview üìÑ

Introduction
Although inspired by the current DEX's on the market, Demodyfi is a decentralized financial platform with a vision to bring financial stability, liquidity and accessibility into the mainstream. It is the go-to open platform for finance-oriented dApps to implement on with smart contracts or integrated protocols with out-of-box cross-chain capabilities, security and financial optimizations.

## Project Details

### Architecture
The Demodyfi protocol supports the value interoperability between different parachains, allowing the tokens on the Polkadot chain to be quickly traded and circulated. The protocol is integrating and combining communication between different blockchains: "Ethereum Compatibility = ‚Äúblockchains on parachains Architecture.‚Äù The protocol utilizes Moonbeam‚Äôs parachain smart contract interoperability while the Substrate framework serves as a fundamental layer. Combining this makes it potential to build on Polkadot, furthermore make it compatible with the EVM, and to deploy EVM-based bytecode compiled from Solidity using tools available from the Ethereum stack.

By Building on Moonbeam, Polkadot and Substrate provide the basis for new forms of societal organization and decision-making. Demodyfi is utilizing Substrate‚Äôs governance and treasury management capabilities along with Polkadot‚Äôs cross-chain messaging to create a decentralized sovereign wealth fund. The goal for this is to fund and secure a parachain slot and continue further development.

### Solutions
- Build a UI that is accessible for the beginner as well as for advanced users.
- Using Polkadot‚Äôs advanced substrate technology to create its own blockchain.
- Focused on market segmentation with all DeFi needs in one place.
- Collaborated decentralized liquidity pools and enabling cross-chain lending for ERC 20 and ERC 721!
- Flash loans integration (cross-chain).
- By utilizing parachain interoperability from Moonbeam, Demodyfi is able to bring in liquidity cross-chain.

## Development Roadmap üî©
### Overview
- **Total Estimated Duration**: 6 months
- **Full-time equivalent (FTE)**: 3
- **Total Costs**: 0.25 BTC

**Milestone 1 ‚Äî Verify Production of Concepts (POC) and Implement Moonbeam Modules (bridging)**
- **Estimated Duration**: 2 months
- **Full-time Equivalent (FTE)**: 2
- **Costs**: 0.05 BTC
In the first milestone, the features for the POC will be implemented and tested by limited users. The users will be able to connect to the moonbeam alpha test net V7.

**Milestone 2 ‚Äî Verify Production of Concepts (POC) and Implement Moonbeam Modules (Swap functions + SDK)**
- **Estimated Duration**: 2 months
- **Full-time Equivalent (FTE)**: 3
- **Costs**: 0.1 BTC
In the first milestone, the additional features for the POC will be implemented and tested.

**Milestone 3 ‚Äî Bridging for token transfers ERC-20 to ERC-721 also known as NFT**
- **Estimated Duration**: 2 months
- **Full-time Equivalent (FTE)**: 1,5
- **Costs**: 0.1 BTC
In the first milestone, the features for NFT will be tested. Tests attracting liquidity from ERC20 towards ERC721 for pooling features. This will mainly be focused on NFT creators and NFT investors with farming mechanisms.
